## Companion Modules

In Flix every enum and trait declaration is associated with a _companion
module_.

### Enum Companions

When we declare an enum, its type and cases are automatically available inside
its companion module. For example, we can write:

```flix
enum Color {
    case Red,
    case Green,
    case Blue
}

mod Color {
    pub def isWarm(c: Color): Bool = match c {
        case Red    => true
        case Green  => false
        case Blue   => false
    }
}
```

Here the `Color` type and the `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` cases are automatically
in scope within the companion `Color` module. 

### Trait Companions

Every trait declaration also gives rise to a companion module.

For example, we can define a trait `Addable` for types whose elements can be added:

```flix
trait Addable[t] {
    pub def add(x: t, y: t): t
}
```

The `Addable` trait implicitly introduces a companion module `Addable`. We
typically use the companion module to store functionality that is related to the
trait. 

For example, we could have:

```flix
mod Addable {
    pub def add3(x: t, y: t, z: t): t with Addable[t] = add(add(x, y), z)
}
```

When accessing a member of `Addable`, Flix will automatically look in both the
trait declaration and its companion namespace. Consequently, `Addable.add`
refers to the trait member `add` whereas `Addable.add3` refers to the
function inside the `Addable` module. Note that the `add` signature is in the
scope of the `Addable` module. 

We should be aware that functions defined in the companion module of a trait
cannot be overridden by instances of the associated trait. Thus we
should only put members into the companion namespace when we do not intend
to override them later.
