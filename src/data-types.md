# Data Types

Flix comes with a collection of built-in data types,
such as booleans, floats and integers, and
compound types, such as tuples and records.
Moreover, the standard library defines types such as
`Option[a]`, `Result[t, e]`, `List[a]`, `Set[a]`,
and `Map[k, v]`.

In addition to these types, Flix allows programmers
to define their own types, including *enumerated
types*, *recursive types*, and *polymorphic types*.

Flix also supports type aliases (new types).
