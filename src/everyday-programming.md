# Everyday Programming

In this chapter we cover some everyday programming features:

- The signature of the `main` function.
- How to print to standard out and standard error.
- How to use string interpolation.
- How to use anonymous and named holes for incomplete programs.
- How to use type ascriptions to explicitly provide some types to the compiler.
