# For-Each and For-Yield

> **Note:** This feature is experimental and not yet intended for use.

In Flix, as in other functional programming languages, most iteration is expressed either through recursion or with combinators (e.g. `map` or `foldLeft`).

That said, Flix has syntactic sugar for two common types of loops: _for-each_ and _for yield_.

## For Each

The _for-each_ construct is useful for iterating over a collection
and apply some transformation to each element and works particularly
well with mutable collections.
This is due to the fact that the _for-each_ loop is actually just
syntactic sugar for a call to `Iterable.foreach` which has return
type `Unit`.
Thus, for the loop to be useful the body of the loop should have an effect.
However, before going any further an example is in order.

To use the _for-each_ loop an instance of `Iterable` on the collection is required.
For this example we will use a `MutList`.

```flix
def main(): Unit & Impure = region r {
    use MutList.push!;

    let l = new MutList(r)
        !> push!(1)
        !> push!(2)
        !> push!(3);

    foreach (x <- l)
        println(x)
}
```

## For Yield

Flix also supports a _for-yield_ construct which is similar to Scala's for-comprehensions
or to Haskell's list comprehension. The _for-yield_ construct is simply syntactic sugar
for uses of `point` and `flatMap` (which requires an instance of the `Monad` type class).
The _for-yield_ construct also supports a _guard_-expression which, when used,
additionally requires an instance of the `MonadZero` type class.

The for-yield expression:

```flix
let l1 = 1 :: 2 :: Nil;
let l2 = 1 :: 2 :: Nil;
for (x <- l1; y <- l2)
    yield (x, y)
```

evaluates to the list:

```flix
(1, 1) :: (1, 2) :: (2, 1) :: (2, 2) :: Nil
```

The for-yield expression:

```flix
let l1 = 1 :: 2 :: Nil;
let l2 = 1 :: 2 :: Nil;
for (x <- l1; y <- l2; if x < y)
    yield (x, y)
```

evaluates to the list:

```flix
(1, 2) :: Nil
```

We can use for-yield on any data type which implements the `Monad` type class. For example, we can iterate through non-empty lists:

```flix
let l1 = Nel(1, 2 :: Nil);
let l2 = Nel(1, 2 :: Nil);
for (x <- l1; y <- l2)
    yield (x, y)
```

which evaluates to the non-empty list:

```flix
Nel((1, 1), (1, 2) :: (2, 1) :: (2, 2) :: Nil)
```

> **Note:** We cannot use an `if`-guard with a non-empty list because such an `if`-guard requires an instance of the `MonadZero` type class which is not implemented by non-empty list. Intuitively, we cannot use a filter in combination with a data structures that cannot be empty.
