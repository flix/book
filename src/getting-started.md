# Getting Started

Getting started with Flix is straightforward. All you need is [Java version 21+](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

You can check if Java is installed and its version by typing:

```shell
$ java -version
```

which should print something like:

```
openjdk version "21" 2023-09-19 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21+35 (build 21+35-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21+35 (build 21+35-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

If Java is not installed or your version is too old, a newer version can be
downloaded from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

Once you have Java 21+ installed there are two ways to proceed:

- You can use the [Flix VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flix.flix) (__highly recommended__) or
- You can run the Flix compiler from the command line.

### Using Flix from Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Flix comes with a fully-featured VSCode plugin. Follow these steps to get
started:

> 1. Create a new empty folder (e.g. `my-flix-project`).
> 2. Open VSCode and choose `File -> Open Folder`.
> 3. Create a new file called `Main.flix` in the folder. 
> 4. VSCode will ask you want to search the marketplace for extensions. Say "Yes".
> 5. The Flix _extension_ will be downloaded and installed. Once done, it will
>    ask if you want to download the Flix _compiler_. Say "Yes" again.
> 6. When you see "Starting Flix" followed by "Flix Ready!" everything should be ready.

### Using Flix from the Command Line

Flix can also be used from the command line. Follow these steps:

> 1. Create a new empty folder (e.g. `my-flix-project`).
> 2. Download the latest `flix.jar` from [https://github.com/flix/flix/releases/latest](https://github.com/flix/flix/releases/latest) and put it into the folder.
> 3. Enter the created directory (e.g. `cd my-flix-project`) and run `java -jar flix.jar init` to create an empty Flix project.
> 4. Run `java -jar flix.jar run` to compile and run the project.

### Troubleshooting

The most common reasons for Flix not working are (a) the `java` command not
being on your `PATH`, (b) the `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable not being set
or being set incorrectly, or (c) having the wrong version of Java installed. To
debug these issues, ensure that:

- The command `java -version` prints the right Java version.
- The `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable is correctly set. 
    - On Windows, you can print the variable by typing `echo %JAVA_HOME%`.
    - On Mac and Linux, you can print the variable by typing `echo $JAVA_HOME`.

If you are still stuck, you can ask for help on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/flix/Lobby).
