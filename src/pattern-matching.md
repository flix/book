## Pattern Matching

### Matching on Enums

Flix supports pattern matching on algebraic data types.

For example, if we have an algebraic data type that models shapes:

```flix
enum Shape {
    case Circle(Int32)
    case Square(Int32)
    case Rectangle(Int32, Int32)
}
```

Then we can write a function to compute the area of a `Shape` using pattern
matching:

```flix
def area(s: Shape): Int32 = match s {
    case Shape.Circle(r)       => 3 * (r * r)
    case Shape.Square(w)       => w * w
    case Shape.Rectangle(h, w) => h * w
}
```

### Matching on Records

The above also works for record types; however, the syntax is slightly different.
Let us rewrite the `Shape` type from before, this time using records.

```flix
enum Shape {
    case Circle({ radius = Int32 })
    case Square({ width = Int32 })
    case Rectangle({ height = Int32, width = Int32 })
}

def area(s: Shape): Int32 = match s {
    case Shape.Circle({ radius })           => 3 * (radius * radius)
    case Shape.Square({ width })            => width * width
    case Shape.Rectangle({ height, width }) => height * width
}
```

In the example above, we implicitly require that each pattern
has exactly the specified labels.
No more, no less.
However, in general, the syntax for record patterns is similar to their types.
Thus, we can match on a record that has at least one specific label.

```flix
def f(r: { height = Int32 | a }): Int32 = match r {
    case { height | _ } => height
    // The extension has a wildcard pattern since it is unused
}
```

Note, however, that the pattern also implies a type,
thus the following example will not work.

```flix
def badTypes(r: { height = Int32 | a }): Int32 = match r {
    case { height } => height
}
```

Additionally, all cases must have the same type,
so this will also not work:

```flix
match ??? {
    case { height | _ } => height
    case { height }     => height
}
```

This may be a contrived example, but it
demonstrates a common pitfall, which is easily fixed.

This is because the first case is a polymorphic record
with a defined `height`-label, whereas the second case
matches on a closed record that *only* has the
`height`-label defined.

Additionally, the `{ label }` pattern is actually
syntactic sugar for `{ label = pattern }`.
Thus, if you are dealing with multiple records,
then it may be necessary to use different patterns.

```flix
def shadowing(r1: { height = Int32 | a }, r2: { height = Int32 | b }): Int32 =
    match (r1, r2) {
        case ({ height | _ }, { height | _ }) => height + height
        // This does not work because `height = height` is defined twice
    }
```

However, renaming the variables makes the program type check.

```flix
def renaming(r1: { height = Int32 | a }, r2: { height = Int32 | b }): Int32 =
    match (r1, r2) {
        case ({ height = h1 | _ }, { height = h2 | _ }) => h1 + h2
    }
```

To summarize, here are a few examples of record patterns:

- `{ }` - the empty record
- `{ radius = r }` - a record containg only the label `radius` where the value is bound to `r` in the scope
- `{ radius }` - a record containing only the label `radius` (this is actually syntactic sugar for `{ radius = radius }`)
- `{ radius | _ }` - a record containg at least the label `radius`
- `{ radius | r }` - a record containg at least the label `radius` where the rest of the record is bound to `r`

### Let Pattern Match

In addition to the pattern `match` construct, a let-binding can be used to
destruct a value. For example:

```flix
let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)
```

Binds the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` to the values `1`, `2`, and `3`,
respectively.

Any exhaustive pattern may be used in a let-binding. For example:

```flix
let (x, Foo(y, z)) = (1, Foo(2, 3))
```

is legal provided that the `Foo` constructor belongs to a type where it is the
only constructor.

The following let-bindings are *illegal* because they are not exhaustive:

```flix
let (1, 2, z) = ...
let Some(x) = ...
```

The Flix compiler will reject such non-exhaustive patterns.

Let-pattern-matches work well with records, as they
allow you to destructure a record and only use the
labels you are interested in:

```flix
let { height | _ } = r;
height + height
```

### Match Lambdas

Pattern matches can also be used with lambda expressions. For example:

```flix
List.map(match (x, y) -> x + y, (1, 1) :: (2, 2) :: Nil)
```

is equivalent to:

```flix
List.map(w -> match w { case (x, y) => x + y }, (1, 1) :: (2, 2) :: Nil)
```

As for let-bindings, such pattern matches must be exhaustive.

Note the difference between the two lambda expressions:

```flix
let f = (x, y, z) -> x + y + z + 42i32
let g = match (x, y, z) -> x + y + z + 42i32
```

Here `f` is a function that expects *three* `Int32` arguments, whereas `g` is a
function that expects *one* three tuple `(Int32, Int32, Int32)` argument.
