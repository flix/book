# Projects

## Creating a Flix Project

You can create and run a new Flix project with `flix new`, for example:

```
% flix new hello-world
Creating project from template "app" in hello-world
% cd hello-world
% flix run
Hello world!
```

## Anatomy of a Flix Project

This is the structure that the above creates:

```svgbob
 |
 +- src
 |   |
 |   '- Main.flix
 |
 +- test
 |   |
 |   '- TestMain.flix
 |
 +- flix.toml
 +- LICENSE.txt
 '- README.md
```

Flix treats any directory containing a file called `flix.toml` as a Flix project. As a minimum, this needs to specify the name of our application and the version of Flix it's expecting to be used to compile it:

```ini
[package]
name = "hello-world"
flix = "0.32.1"
```

There are two different basic types of Flix project:

* **Applications:** Collections of source files and other resources (e.g. HTML files, images, ...) which are built into an executable project.

* **Libraries:** Collections of source files and other resources which are intended for use within applications (or other libraries).

By default `flix new` creates an application project, but it can be used to create a library by specifying the `lib` template: `flix new --template lib my-new-library`.

> ðŸ¤” Note: We should allow the creation of user defined templates to automate the creation of more complex projects, e.g. web apps (which in addition to the above would have a `resources` directory, `index.html`, default routes, etc.).
