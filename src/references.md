## References

Flix supports mutable _scoped_ references. A reference is a box whose value can
change over time. The three key reference operations are:

- Creating a new reference `ref e @ rc`.
- Dereferencing a reference `deref e`.
- Assigning to a reference `e := e`.

In Flix, the type of a reference is `Ref[t, r]` where `t` is the type of the
element and `r` is its region. Like all mutable memory in Flix, every reference
must belong to some region. Reading from and writing to a reference are
_effectful_ operations. For example, reading the value of a reference `Ref[t,
r]` has effect `r`.

The `ref e @ rc` operation allocates a reference cell in a region of the heap
and returns its location, the `deref` operation dereferences a location and
returns the content of a reference cell, and the assigment `:=` operation
changes the value of a reference cell. Informally, a reference cell can be
thought of as an "object" with a single field that can be changed.

### Allocating References

A reference cell is allocated with the `ref e @ rc` syntax. For example:

```flix
region rc {
    let c = ref 42 @ rc;
    println(deref c)
}
```

Here we introduce a region named `rc`. Inside the region, we create a reference
cell called `c` with the value `42` which we then dereference and print.

### Dereferencing References

A reference cell is accessed (dereferenced) with the `deref e` syntax. For example:

```flix
region rc {
    let c = ref 42 @ rc;
    let x = deref c;
    let y = deref c;
    println(x + y)
}
```

Here the program prints `42 + 42 = 84`.

### Assignment

We can update the value of a reference cell. For example:

```flix
region rc {
    let c = ref 0 @ rc;
    c := (deref c) + 1;
    c := (deref c) + 1;
    c := (deref c) + 1;
    println(deref c)
}
```

Here the program creates a reference cell `c` with the value `0`. We dereference
the cell and increment its value three times. Hence the program prints `3`.

### Example: A Simple Counter

We can use references to implement a simple counter:

```flix
enum Counter[r: Region] { // The Region here is a type-kind
    case Counter(Ref[Int32, r])
}

def newCounter(rc: Region[r]): Counter[r] \ r = Counter.Counter(ref 0 @ rc)

def getCount(c: Counter[r]): Int32 \ r =
    let Counter.Counter(l) = c;
    deref l

def increment(c: Counter[r]): Unit \ r =
    let Counter.Counter(l) = c;
    l := (deref l) + 1

def main(): Unit \ IO =
    region rc {
        let c = newCounter(rc);
        increment(c);
        increment(c);
        increment(c);
        getCount(c) |> println
    }
```

Here the `Counter` data type has a region type parameter. This is required since
the counter internally uses a reference that requires a region. Hence `Counter`s
are also scoped. Note that the `newCounter` function requires a region handle to
create a new `Counter`. Moreover, note that the functions `getCount` and
`increment` both have the `r` effect.

### Aliasing and References to References

References naturally support aliasing since that is their purpose. For example:

```flix
region rc {
    let l1 = ref 42 @ rc;
    let l2 = l1;
    l2 := 84;
    println(deref l1)
}
```

Prints `84` because the reference cell that `l1` points to is modified through
the alias `l2`.

References can also point to references as the following example illustrates:

```flix
region rc {
    let l1 = ref 42 @ rc;
    let l2 = ref l1 @ rc;
    let rs = deref (deref l2);
    println(rs)
}
```

Here the type of `l2` is `Ref[Ref[Int32, rc], rc]`.

### Mutable Tuples and Records

Flix tuples and records are _immutable_. However, tuples and records may contain
mutable references.

For example, here is a pair that contains two mutable references:

```flix
region rc {
    let p = (ref 1 @ rc, ref 2 @ rc);
    fst(p) := 123
};
```

The type of the pair is `(Ref[Int32, rc], Ref[Int32, rc])`. The assignment does
not change the pair but instead changes the value of the reference cell in the
first component.

Similarly, here is a record that contains two mutable references:

```flix
region rc {
    let r = { fstName = ref "Lucky" @ rc, lstName = ref "Luke" @ rc };
    r.fstName := "Unlucky"
};
```

The type of the record is `{ fstName = Ref[String, rc], lstName = Ref[String,
rc] }`. Again, the assignment does not change the record, but instead changes
the value of the reference cell corresponding to the `fstName` label.
